# Environment Configuration for Railway

## Production Environment Variables

### Required Variables
```
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Optional Variables (for better WebRTC performance)
```
PUBLIC_IP=your-public-ip-here
HOST=0.0.0.0
```

### Railway Specific Variables
```
PORT=3000  # Automatically set by Railway
RAILWAY_STATIC_URL=your-app-url.railway.app
```

## Development vs Production

### Development (.env.local)
```
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
PUBLIC_IP=0.0.0.0
HOST=localhost
```

### Production (Railway)
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000  # Set by Railway
PUBLIC_IP=undefined  # Let MediaSoup auto-detect
HOST=0.0.0.0
```

## WebRTC Configuration Notes

1. **Railway Limitations**:
   - No direct UDP port control
   - Dynamic IP addresses
   - NAT traversal challenges

2. **Workarounds**:
   - Use STUN servers (Google's public STUN)
   - Implement TURN servers for production
   - Consider TCP fallback

3. **Production Recommendations**:
   - Use dedicated VPS with static IP
   - Configure proper firewall rules
   - Implement proper STUN/TURN infrastructure
